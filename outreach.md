title: Outreach Projects
subtitle: For schools and the general public

During my PhD I have been involved in several outreach projects. These have been aimed at a variety of audiences and with different motivations for each. Some attempted to broadly introduce exoplanetary science to members of the general public while others aimed to give a more in-depth summary of the subject to school students so that they gained an insight into the realities of science and academic research.

**ORBYTS Fellow (February - June 2024)**

As a second year PhD student I ran an ORBYTS project for a group of year 10 students. Over five months, I introduced the group to the field of exoplanets and provided them with the foundations in python to be able to model exoplanet atmospheres using TauREx3. The students then took an published spectrum, reproduced the data with a model and investigated molecules that were not found in the spectrum and tried to determine at what abundance they would be detectable if present.
