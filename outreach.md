**ORBYTS Fellow - 2024**

As a second year PhD student I ran an ORBYTS project for a group of year 10 students. Over five months, I introduced the group to the field of exoplanets and provided them with the foundations in python to be able to model exoplanet atmospheres using TauREx3. The students then took an published spectrum, reproduced the data with a model and investigated molecules that were not found in the spectrum and tried to determine at what abundance they would be detectable if present.
