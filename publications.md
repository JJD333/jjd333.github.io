Abstract: With the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offering higher resolution data in space-based transmission spectroscopy, understanding the capabilities of our current atmospheric retrieval pipelines is essential. These new data cover wider wavelength ranges and at much higher spectral resolution than previous instruments have been able to offer. Therefore, it is often appealing to bin spectra to fewer points, better constrained in their transit depth, before using them as inputs for atmospheric retrievals. However, little quantitative analysis of the trade-off between spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio has been conducted thus far. As such, we produce a simulation replicating the observations of WASP-39b by the NIRSpec PRISM instrument on board JWST and assess the accuracy and consistency of retrievals while varying resolution and the average photometric error. While this probes a specific case we also plot 'binning paths' in the resulting sensitivity maps to demonstrate the best attainable atmospheric parameter estimations starting from the position of the real JWST Early Release Science observation. We repeat this analysis on three different simulation setups where each includes an opaque cloud layer at a different height in the atmosphere. We find that a much greater resolution is needed in the case of a high cloud deck since features are already heavily muted by the presence of the clouds. In the other two cases, there are large 'safe zones' in the parameter space. If these maps can be generalised, binning paths could inform future observations on how to achieve the most accurate retrieval results.
