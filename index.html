<p>I'm Jack, a fourth year PhD student studying at UCL.</p> 

<p>The focus of my research is the investigation of the atmospheres of exoplanets.
Specifically, I study the methods that we use to analyse data coming in from
space-based telescopes. With new and upcoming missions (such as the James Webb
Space Telescope and Ariel) we are entering into a new era in the field. The great 
improvement in the quality of spectra that these instruments can offer means there
are new questions to answer and new avenues of research that need to be explored!</p>
